> **2,.**Detection of Digital Face Manipulations
>
> **Goal** : A comprehensive approach for digital face manipulation detection and how these methods can improve the security of face recognition systems.
>
> 4.23.1 Background
>
> Digital face manipulations are any alterations to a face which occur in the digital domain, examples include face swapping, morphing, and retouch- ing. Researchers have shown that manipulated faces can impair the effi- cacy of face recognition systemsTo mitigate this, researchers are currently developing approaches for detecting digitally manipulated face images.
>
> 4.23.2 Task
>
> Conduct a survey on existing methods for detecting digital face manipu- lations. Motivate the work by describing how digital face manipulations can hamper face recognition performance and lead to loss of trust in digital content. Describe different approaches by answering the questions:
>
> * Which detection algorithm is used?
> * What kind of manipulations are considered?
> * How is the algorithm trained and how well does it compare to other approaches?
> * Is there any freely available implementation of the method?
> * Discuss advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches as
>   well as current research challenge
